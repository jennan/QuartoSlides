User2,Health sciences,Windows,70,100,70,70,50,60,I would have liked to have learned more about random forest analysis.,The deep learning lessons were too fast and not detailed enough. It often wasn't clear what we were doing and why.,Detractor,4,
User3,Biological sciences,Linux,100,100,100,80,30,100,NIL,Slow down coding parts to allow people to catch up,Promoter,9,NIL
User4,Engineering,Windows,92,100,90,80,80,81,Google Colab,Does the workshop have to be in the afternoon? Some days it can be quite hard to follow when energy levels low,Passive,8,N/A
User5,Engineering,Windows,100,100,86,99,66,78,instructor led coding. ,Explain more and give more pauses while teaching,Promoter,10,
User6,Health sciences,Windows,80,80,80,60,50,50,Code available online from syllabus ,Double check code before running to avoid error messages and going back and forth ,Passive,7,Thank you very much
User7,Health sciences,macOS,53,73,73,58,30,37,,The code displayed should match the code in the slides.,Detractor,6,
User8,Engineering,Windows,90,100,100,100,20,80,"DL using real dataset, not toy dataset",Slow down when writing and explaining code,Promoter,9,No

User10,Engineering,Windows,84,100,76,70,56,56,"The patience instructors had with all our questions, with typos also the helpers were always there, last 2 days were bit fast paced but the 2nd day way of teaching was the best. Overall amazing ",The lesson planned shared codes didn't always give the right answers,Passive,8,It was great as I had kept planning on it but thanks to you guys .I am on point with this now.

User12,Biomedical and clinical sciences,Windows,100,100,,100,100,86,This was exactly the kickstart to start applying ML to my research.,"more time for the content covered in the last 2 days. Also, would be nice to see a good performing model in action (often only got a little over 60% accuracy) ",Promoter,10,
User13,Engineering,Windows,90,100,100,100,80,80,MLP perceptron,Slower pace at CNN coding,Promoter,10,All awesome !
User14,Biomedical and clinical sciences,macOS,69,92,91,90,62,91,Could more content be made available before hand to get up to speed before the sessions,"As above, that would help with the speed needed to get through the content ",Promoter,10,"It was great, I learnt a lot!!"
User15,Engineering,Windows,80,80,80,80,80,48,more theory discussion,no copy paste during coding (makes instructor encounter typos also same as the attendees,Promoter,10,really great
User16,Engineering,Windows,92,93,93,93,51,82,realistic application and results,more exercises and problems,Promoter,10,
User17,Engineering,Linux,70,100,100,70,50,91,The lesson code and description are available after the session.,More graphics explaining code flow or processes. Like flowcharts or state machines.,Passive,8,
User18,Information and computing sciences,Windows,92,100,100,100,60,80,A recording of the session would be great ,Reduce the speed,Promoter,10,
