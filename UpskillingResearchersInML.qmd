# todo
- put links for lightning talk and BoF
- put links to NeSI and CeR

# Overview

::: {.incremental}
some intro
:::

## This talk's focus

- Lightning Talk earlier today was mainly about answering 'what' we did and metrics
- This talk is focused on the delivery
  - two perspectives: CeR and NeSI 
- BoF (right after this talk) will be a broader discussion of a similar topic 

## This talk's Goal

- share our experience
  - lessons learned
  - what went well, what didn't, how we would do it differently
- emphasising on some best-pracitices
- encourage others to do similar things
  - because *the time is now*
  - you need less resources than you might expect

## This talk's Structure

- we (CeR and NeSI) won't talk about these topics one after the other
- we picked some perspectives and will share them in parallel

## How the ML sessions were executed

- CeR and NeSI independently made the decision to base the workshops on existing material (The Carpentries) and ([Scikit-learn Tutorial(https://github.com/jakevdp/sklearn_tutorial) by 
[Jake Vanderplas]](https://github.com/jakevdp))
- The underlying idea was to start with foundational ML aspects and to build up
- different session times
  - Column left: show details of ML101 and ML201
  - Column right: show details of Carp Sessions
- Maybe a comparison of content covered

## Resoures used

- Colab
- JupyterHub?

# Recommendations

- use existing material
- don't be afraid to use Colab, etc. you don't need fancy GPUs, even though you can have some
- decision if Python is prerequisite or not?!

# How to get in touch

- email abc
