## Introduction to Machine Learning with Scikit Learn
- Nelis introduced us to the topic 
- Mike built on that 
- Regression and Classification
- Ensemble methods, Clustering, Dimension reduction

## Introduction to Deep Learning
- Nidhi switched from generic ML to Deep Learning (DL)
- Some aspects (there are more:)   
  - ML: is non-stoachstic; similar if not the same result
  - DL: non-convex and complex
  - DL: only estimated/non-deterministic results/*every run can differ a bit*
  - DL: of uses neural networks, but also DBN, VAEs, etc.
  - DL: tends to use way more resources (CPU/GPU)
  - ML: Can still solve a lot of real-world issues using limilted resources



## Workflows for heavier computation
- Google Colab vs. ~~locally installed Jupyter Notebooks~~ or ~~Plain Vanilla Python~~
  - Do all use Colab 'in the real world' all the time? No!
  	- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  	- Python locally installed
    	- Virtual Environment
    	- `pip install`
  	- using GPU/[Nectar](https://research-hub.auckland.ac.nz/research-software-and-computing/advanced-compute/nectar-research-cloud)/...

# Recommended next steps
- This was a lot of content!
- Go through the examples in the near future / try to practice these techniques in your own research context
  - Set yourself a deadline
  - not: *I will do that one day*; that day never comes!
- Please fill out the [Survey](https://auckland.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_7QKm5JodbHrRaWW) before leaving this session
- Join the [Hacky Hour](https://research-hub.auckland.ac.nz/digital-research-skills/hacky-hour) channel
  - Hacky Hour - Tuesdays 3-4pm [on Zoom]([link](https://auckland.zoom.us/my/hackyhour))
  - Our instructors/helpers will be on hand for the next 4 Hacky Hour sessions to help you apply what we‚Äôve covered this week.

# Kaggle
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is an AI community aimed at getting a better understanding/practice.
There are competitions that we can recommend:

- Regression:
  - [House Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) :house:
- Classification:
  - [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/data) :ship:
  - [Spaceship Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/data) üõ∞Ô∏è :ship:
  - [mnist digit recognition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data) :pen: (probably quite a bit harder just because of the data input/processing)
  
(Alternative to Kaggle: [Scikit Toy Datasets](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html))

# Good luck

- Stay in touch with us on your ML/DL/AI journey
- Use it or lose it
- ML/DL tools are valuable to your research now and your research or other career path
