to do
- table needs to contain dates (Monday, 5th of something through to bla)
- put a plot for Zoom attendance
- put plot for likelihood of recommendation
- shuffle plots (maybe put likelyhood of recommd. as first, then feed with details?)

# The Core
- This talk shall answer *What's that ML-Carp Workshop*
  - what was done
  - who pariticpanted and how they liked it
  - what was changed
- This feeds in to upcoming sessions
  - *Upskilling researchers in Machine Learning*
  - BoF Session: *AI Skill Training Pathway: Bridging Gaps and Fostering Inclusivity*
  - painpoints, differences between NeSI and CeR, etc


# What was done
## Background

- Machine Learning (ML) or Artificial Intelligence (AI) are without a doubt hot topics
- Empowering reserachers to **understand and use** ML seems rewarding, but also challenging
- [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/)  offer a proven teaching style also supporting participants with limited IT experience
  - ![The Carpentries](TheCarpentries.svg){ width=20% }
  - (core aspects are live-coding, a positive attitude not anticipating prerequirments and participant invovlement)
- The [CeR (Centre for eResearch)](http://eresearch.auckland.ac.nz/) at the University of Auckland acquired funding to further develop and run a series of workshops, referred to as *ML-Carp*
- Two iterations (referred to as *Run #1* and *Run#2*) took place


## Lesson Overview


| Lesson Title                                       | Status                                                                                       | Run #1   | Run #2                    |   |

*Each session took place on an afternoon for 4 hours over Zoom*

- Depending on Maturity, sessions were run with a few changes or in big parts (re)developed.
- One major change was [Goolge Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) ![Colab](./Google_Colaboratory_SVG_Logo.svg){ width=3% } being used instead of local Python installs.

# Who Pariticpanted And How They Liked It

Large sign-up numbers meant mandatory *expression of interest* and filtering

## Participants' Background

## Participants' OS

{{< embed Plots.ipynb#participants-os >}}

## Participants' Feelings - Metrics

{{< embed Plots.ipynb#participants-agreement >}}

## Participants' Feelings - Statements

- various, most without background
- strong Zoom attendance
- observation: Even at the very end of the sessions, questions, participantion and interest didn't cease

- common feedback: Python was too much
  - Run #2: Python was removed from the curriculum
- common feedback: More breaks
  - Run #2: better schedule
- common feedback: only one interface (not VSC and Colab)
  - Run #2: only Colab, VSC etc. was linked to for post-workshop engagement

<!-- # Reflection on Run #1 and adaption
- The learning curve appeared too steep. From no coding to refined DL approaches in a few days appeared too challenging
  - (some) Python knowledge was made a prerequisite for the Run #2. That hasn't lead to a decline in registrations
  - Two (half) days of Python being removed from this run's curriculum freed up time to allow for more breaks, an even slower pace and answering more specific questions
- End of the run shouldn't imply ceasing communication with (most) participants
  - while some researchs continue to stay in touch with CeR after Run #1, to keep up the momentum of more participants, after the end of the workshop should be less of a cut and more 'faded out'
    - A curated set of links for self-study was deemed too generic with an anticipated low continued interst in fully self-motivated  
    - Slack sub channel with targeted support
    - Kaggle?
    - VSC and local Python/GPU/Nectar/... 
    - ![Comparison](ComparisonRevRun1And2.jpg) TODO: make this appear and disappear

# What participants of Run #1 said
## What 1 thing did you like and would want to see in future workshops?
- *"apply these ML techniques on the different field"*
  - hard to achieve, focus on underlying theory
- *"slower pace"*
  - removed Python from curriculum 
- *"some research paper example?"*
  - hard
- *"add some quick group exercise session or quiz"*
  - more links/examples after the run
- *"many people were online to help the students"*
  - continued with many helpers

## What 1 thing you do think we could do better?
- too fast
- separate Python 
- adhering to break schedule

  # Comparing Run #1 and #2: What metrics and people say
  - what the numbers say 
    - more people signed up (word of mouth/positive experince being shared?)
    - more of this and that
  - what the pepole say
    - instrcutors/organisers (for the sake of bervity no full quotes)
      - better balance of topics (only ML, DL vs. having to cope with Python)
    - participants
      - ... -->

# Outlook
- while specific funding (for lesson preparation and delivery) has ended, the importance of the topic continues to increase
- more sessions are planned
- current Slack seems promising
- the decision to teach Python at SW Carp was deemed good
